## ü§ñ AI Helper Matching Algorithm

The system uses a weighted scoring algorithm to rank potential helpers:

```javascript
Helper Score = (Skill Score √ó 0.4) + (History Score √ó 0.3) + (Engagement Score √ó 0.3)
```

### Components:
1. **Skill Relevance (40%)**: Percentage of required skills that match user's skills
2. **History Score (30%)**: Based on resolved issues count and average rating
3. **Engagement Score (30%)**: Recent activity and current availability

## üìä Database Schema

### User Model
- Basic info (name, email, employee ID)
- Skills array with levels and verification
- Rating and contribution tracking
- Availability status
- Department and position

### Issue Model
- Title, description, category, priority
- Required skills for resolution
- Location information
- Assignment and resolution tracking
- Comments and voting system
- File attachments

## üîí Security Features
